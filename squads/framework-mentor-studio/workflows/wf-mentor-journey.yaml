  This is the primary workflow of the Framework Mentor Studio squad.
  It guides the user through a 5-phase journey:

  Phase 1: DIAGNOSE — Identify your unique expertise and zone of genius
  Phase 2: EXTRACT — Capture and structure tacit knowledge into a framework
  Phase 3: PACKAGE — Create your signature offer and pricing
  Phase 4: POSITION — Establish authority in your niche
  Phase 5: LAUNCH — Acquire first clients and start generating revenue

  Each phase has clear inputs, outputs, checkpoints, and handoffs between agents.
