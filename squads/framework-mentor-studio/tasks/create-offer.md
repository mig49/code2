Transform your signature framework into an irresistible premium offer with value-based pricing. Phase 3 of the Mentor Journey.

## Pre-conditions
- Signature framework documented (Phase 2)
- Framework name and visual available

## Process

### Step 1: Value Equation Design (@alex-hormozi)

**Dream Outcome (maximize):**
- "What is the #1 result your client wants?"
- "What does success look like in their words?"
- "What would they pay anything to achieve?"

**Perceived Likelihood (maximize):**
- "Why should they believe YOUR method works?"
- "What proof do you have? (testimonials, case studies, credentials)"
- "What guarantees can you offer?"

**Time Delay (minimize):**
- "How quickly can they see first results?"
- "What quick wins can you deliver in week 1?"

**Effort & Sacrifice (minimize):**
- "What do they NOT have to do with your method?"
- "What's the easiest entry point?"

**Offer Stack:**
- Core: Your main mentoring program
- Bonus 1: Framework template/canvas (they get to use your tool)
- Bonus 2: Community access or peer group
- Bonus 3: Quick-win session (immediate value)
- Guarantee: Results-based or time-based

**Naming:**
- Name the offer using Hormozi's naming formula
- [Adjective] + [Time Frame] + [Container Word] + [Specific Result]
- Example: "The 90-Day Framework Accelerator"

### Step 2: Value-Based Pricing (@alan-weiss)

**Conceptual Agreement Process:**
1. **Objectives:** "What are you trying to accomplish?"
2. **Metrics:** "How will we know we've succeeded?"
3. **Value:** "What is achieving this worth to you/your business?"

**Three Tier Options:**
- Option 1 (Good): Core mentoring only
- Option 2 (Better): Mentoring + framework review + templates
- Option 3 (Best): VIP — all-inclusive with direct access

**Pricing Logic:**
- "Your fee should be 10-20% of the value you deliver"
- "If the value is R$100k over a year, R$10k-20k is reasonable"
- "Start where you're comfortable, raise every 3 clients"

**Proposal Format (2.5 pages max):**
1. Situation Appraisal
2. Objectives
3. Metrics
4. Value
5. Methodology (your framework)
6. Options (3 tiers)
7. Timing
8. Terms
