# Task: Extract Framework

## Metadata
- **id:** fms-extract-framework
- **name:** Extract and Structure Your Signature Framework
- **agents:** @susanna-reay, @tiago-forte
- **elicit:** true
- **mode:** interactive
- **estimated_time:** 60-120 minutes

## Purpose
Transform tacit expertise into a documented, named, visual, teachable signature framework. This is Phase 2 of the Mentor Journey and the CORE task of the squad.

## Pre-conditions
- Phase 1 (Diagnose) complete
- Unique Ability Statement available
- Patterns identified (minimum 3)

## Process

### Step 1: Knowledge Capture (@tiago-forte)

Using the CODE method:

**C — Capture:**
- "Brain dump everything you know about your expertise area"
- "List every tool, technique, principle you use"
- "What books/courses/experiences shaped your methodology?"
- Capture raw material without filtering

**O — Organize (PARA):**
- Projects: Current client work, active teaching
- Areas: Core expertise domains
- Resources: Reference material, inspiration
- Archives: Past work, completed projects

**D — Distill (Progressive Summarization):**
- From brain dump → bold the key concepts
- From key concepts → highlight the core 5-7 principles
- From principles → write executive summary

**E — Express:**
- "If you had to teach someone your method in 1 hour, what would you cover?"
- Identify intermediate packets (reusable building blocks)

**Output:** Knowledge inventory with 5-7 core principles

### Step 2: Framework Design (@susanna-reay)

Using the SPARK Process:

**S — Simplify:**
- Take the 5-7 principles and reduce to essential structure
- "What's the minimum someone needs to know?"
- Remove jargon, keep substance
- Target: 3-7 steps or pillars

**P — Package:**
- Choose framework type:
  - **Process framework** (sequential steps — best for methodologies)
  - **Matrix framework** (2x2 or grid — best for decision-making)
  - **Diagnostic framework** (assessment — best for audits)
  - **Pyramid framework** (hierarchical — best for priority/foundations)
  - **Cycle framework** (iterative — best for ongoing processes)

**A — Articulate:**
- Name your framework (should be memorable, ownable)
- Naming patterns:
  - Acronym (SPARK, PARA, CODE)
  - Numbered (5 Forces, 7 Habits, 4Cs)
  - Metaphor (Flywheel, Funnel, Bridge)
- Create one-sentence description

**R — Replicate:**
- Design how clients will USE the framework
- Create worksheet/canvas for application
- Define assessment criteria
- Build teaching sequence

**K — Keynote:**
- Prepare 10-minute presentation of your framework
- Structure: Problem → Framework → Results → Call to Action
- Create visual slide/diagram

## Deliverables

1. **Signature Framework Document** (docs/signature-framework.md):
   - Framework name
   - One-sentence description
   - Visual representation (ASCII art or diagram description)
   - Full documentation of each step/component
   - Application guide
   - Assessment criteria

2. **Framework Canvas** (filled template):
   - Problem it solves
   - Target audience
   - Steps/components
   - Key principles per step
   - Expected outcomes
   - Common mistakes

3. **Teaching Guide:**
   - How to explain in 2 minutes
   - How to teach in 30 minutes
   - How to apply in a 90-day engagement

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] Framework has a unique name
- [ ] 3-7 clear steps or components
- [ ] Visual representation created
- [ ] Each component documented with principles and actions
- [ ] Application guide written
- [ ] Framework Canvas template filled
- [ ] Can be explained in 2 minutes (elevator test)

## Veto Conditions
- Framework has > 7 steps → Simplify (too complex to teach)
- Framework has < 3 steps → Expand (too simplistic for premium pricing)
- No unique name → Cannot proceed, naming is essential for IP
- Cannot be drawn → Rework (if you can't draw it, you don't own it)

## Handoff
- **To:** @alex-hormozi + @alan-weiss (Phase 3: Create Offer)
- **Context:** Named framework + documentation + visual + teaching guide
