## Metadata
- **id:** fms-position
- **name:** Establish Your Authority Position
- **agents:** @blair-enns, @david-baker
- **elicit:** true
- **mode:** interactive
- **estimated_time:** 30-60 minutes

## Purpose
Position yourself as the go-to authority in your niche using expertise-based positioning. Phase 4 of the Mentor Journey.

## Pre-conditions
- Offer created (Phase 3)
- Framework documented (Phase 2)
- Positioning statement from Phase 1

## Process

### Step 1: Expertise Positioning (@blair-enns)

**Current Level Assessment:**
```
Where are you on the expertise spectrum?
1. Generalist — "I help businesses grow"
2. Specialist — "I help SaaS companies grow"
3. Expert — "I help SaaS companies reduce churn using my method"
4. Authority — "Companies come to me because of my documented framework"
5. Thought Leader — "I've redefined how the industry thinks about this"
```

**Win Without Pitching Principles:**
- Replace pitching with conversations
- Diagnose before you prescribe
- Let the client come to you (pull, not push)
- Your expertise should be evident, not described

**Diagnostic Conversation Framework:**
- Design a 30-minute "diagnostic session" that demonstrates your expertise
- Structure: Questions → Diagnosis → Insight → Invitation
- "Never prescribe before you diagnose"

### Step 2: Content Authority Strategy (@david-baker)

**Content Pillars (from your framework):**
- One pillar per framework component
- Each pillar generates 4-5 content pieces

**Channel Strategy (for The Authentic archetype):**
- Primary: Long-form articles/newsletter (weekly)
- Secondary: Videos explaining framework components
- Tertiary: Community interaction
- Avoid: TikTok, cold outreach, mass events

**First Month Content Calendar:**
- Week 1: "The problem I solve" (story-driven)
- Week 2: Framework overview (visual + explanation)
- Week 3: Deep dive on step 1 of your framework
- Week 4: Case study / before-after story

## Deliverables
1. **Positioning Strategy** (docs/positioning-strategy.md):
