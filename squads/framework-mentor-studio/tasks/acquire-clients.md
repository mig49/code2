Create a client acquisition strategy and 90-day revenue roadmap. Phase 5 (final) of the Mentor Journey.

## Pre-conditions
- Offer complete (Phase 3)
- Positioning defined (Phase 4)

## Process

### Step 1: High-Touch Client Creation (@rich-litvin)

**Identify Powerful Prospects:**
- "List 10 people in your network who could benefit from your mentoring"
- "Who do you admire and would love to work with?"
- "Who has the resources to invest in premium mentoring?"

**Design Enrollment Conversation:**
- Not a pitch — a genuine coaching session
- Structure:
  1. Connect (5 min): Build rapport authentically
  2. Explore (15 min): Deep questions about their challenges
  3. Insight (5 min): Share ONE insight from your framework
  4. Invite (5 min): "Would you like to explore working together?"

**Free Session Strategy:**
- Offer 2-3 free sessions to build proof
- Structure the session to deliver real value
- Ask for testimonial/referral in exchange

**Retention Design:**
- Deep coaching model (challenge + support)
- Regular touchpoints (biweekly recommended)
- Progress tracking using your framework

### Step 2: Lead Generation System (@alex-hormozi)

**Warm Outreach (5 conversations/week):**
- Script template for reaching out
- "I've been developing a framework for [problem]. Would love your perspective."
- Not selling — starting conversations

**Free Content (1 post/week):**
- Take something complex from your domain
- Simplify it using your framework
- Share as article/post/video

**90-Day Revenue Roadmap:**

| Period | Actions | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Days 1-7 | List 10 prospects, offer 2 free sessions | 2 conversations |
| Days 8-14 | 5 warm outreach, create offer MVP page | 5 conversations |
| Days 15-30 | Free sessions, first paid client, 4 content posts | 1-2 clients, R$1.5k-3k/mo |
| Days 31-60 | 5 outreach/week, referral requests, price adjustment | 3-4 clients, R$4.5k-12k/mo |
| Days 61-90 | Newsletter launch, raise price, systematize | 5 clients, R$7.5k-15k/mo |

## Deliverables
1. **Launch Plan** (docs/launch-plan.md):
   - Prospect list template
   - Enrollment conversation script
